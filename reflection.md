# Reflection

## Advice to self if I do a project like this again:
Figure out how to make better scope values for objects such as sprites and coins so I don't have to repeat them again. It would allow for more efficient code. Also next time I think I would try to take a bit more time after school to work on my project as there was a lot of things I wanted to add in that I couldn't due to time constraints. However I do believe that I used the work time I had in class appropiately for the entire duration we had.

## Hardest part of the project?
I believe that the hardest part of creating the object was really just understanding how the p5.play library worked. Once I troubleshooted and went through how all the different functions and features worked, the rest of the project came to me naturally and I was able to use sprites groups, camera and more p5.play functions without fuss.

## Did you complete the Needs to Have List?
Yes I completed all the objectives I sought out in my needs to have list, though I did move the addition of more enemy types midway through the project to Nice To Haves as I thought that the regular asteroids were enough to suffice for the game itself. Which didn't really mater cause I did end up making the extra enemy later as an asteroid boss which spawns periodically throughout the game. The only thing that I wish I could have added was a start menu but I had problems with calling items once like in a setup style function, however I did create a working game over screen with a restart button so I'm happy that was able to work.

## What are you most proud of?
I think I'm most proud of the whole process of creating the project, I've never programmed anything of this stature before and it really is cool seeing something come to fruition from just an idea that just sparked at the beginning. I'm also very proud that I learned how to use the p5.play library from scratch as we never learned about it in class. Overall I just think that the whole journey of creating this project is what was really rewarding and satisfying, and seeing someone like my little brother Hassam get excited to play something I created is heartwarming haha.

## Closing Remarks
By the way I'd like to mention! Thanks for everything Mr. Schellenberg, I really learned a lot through this quarter in your class and I enjoyed my time thoroughly! I'll be sure to come back in comp sci club for my remaining grade 11/12 years!
