## Hardest part of the project?
I believe that the hardest part of creating the object was really just understanding how the p5.play library worked. Once I troubleshooted and went through how all the different functions and features worked, the rest of the project came to me naturally.

## Did you complete the Needs to Have List?
Yes I completed all the objectives I sought out in my needs to have list, I did move the addition of more enemy types midway to Nice To Haves as I thought that the asteroid were enough to suffice for the game itself.

## What are you most proud of?
