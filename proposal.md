# Major Project Proposal

- Create a classic asteroids style game
- Has the addition of a virtual camera for greater exploration of an area
- This will be done through the use of the p5.play library
- Although the initial style of the game could be changed (such as having a character walk around instead of a ship), the main idea is to create an "open world" style game based off the virtual camera provided by p5.play

## Must Have List

- player plane physics
- implementation of virtual camera (follows the player)
- collidable asteroids
- some type of non asteroids enemy

## Nice to Have List

- main menu
- points/upgrades system
- new explorable areas
